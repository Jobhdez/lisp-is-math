3. so, lisp is beautiful

## Interesting fact

My equivalent linear algebra javascript [program](https://github.com/Jobhdez/JSlalg) is about 300 lines of code. This clojure version is only 50.

Note: I can reduce js code as well to about 50 lines as well since js is a lambda language; but one can imagine that there is situations where the use of lisp macros are the only way to express something in lisp and if this is the case then a language without macros cannot have such powerful abstraction.
